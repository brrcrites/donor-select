# Donor Select

This application was designed as a demo app for a [UCR BioHack 2019](https://biohackucr.com/) introduction to web and firebase workshop.

It started with [this prep guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f59AEdQBhDv_VNVv_qFTDPfXsfGKxase1tK9-tyRDW8/edit?usp=sharing) for participants to setup the basics before they came and then [these walkthrough slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vVvfUvc5ymNRiv-Mp2htt_iFle5G_jSWf3wp20AQshQ/edit?usp=sharing) for developing and deploying the site.
